|libmodal| is a Neovim library/|plugin| aimed at simplifying the creation
of new "modes" (e.g. |Insert|, |Normal|). The entrance of modes is
creator-defined, and their exit defaults to <Esc>. The use and name of
modes is also creator-defined, and is outlined in |libmodal-usage|.

See: |vim-modes|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USE CASE                                           *libmodal-use-case-example*

As an |init.vim| configuration grows, it becomes harder to create keybindings
that alphabetically represent the action that they perform. To get around
this, |libmodal| allows users to create a new "layer" of keybindings contained
within a pseudo-|vim-mode|. This layer of keybindings can be bound to a
command which executes `libmodal.mode.enter()` or `libmodal.prompt.enter()`,
and any settings outside of these commands are preserved.

For example, say that a user of Neovim regularly uses |:diffsplit| to merge
changes from `git`. They might define a "DIFF" mode that takes input and
directly translates it into |:diff|* operations. This would allow them to

For instance, perhaps this mode is defined so that `n` goes to the next diff
(like `]c`), and `N` goes to the previous diff (like `[c`). This would make
going from diff to diff more rememberable, as `n` is commonly used because of
`/` searches.

Suppose that the mode also numbers each |:buffer|, so that you don't have
to remember which |:diffsplit| to |:diffget| from. The numbers would disappear
when you leave the mode.

Finally, there could be a help key, `?`, which would show exactly which keys
have been mapped and what they do.

You can see such a mode here:
* https://gist.github.com/Iron-E/f36116e8862ea03fd195e4e0a48cb05d

Outside of the |libmodal-mode|, `n` still searches for the |last-pattern|, and
the buffers are not visibly numbered. Any setup that a |libmodal-mode| does to
inderpret keybindings is undone before the mode ends (while any changes to
buffers persevere).

See: |libmodal-usage|

2. Usage                                                      *libmodal-usage*

The |libmodal| interface is designed completely in |Lua|. It is compatable
with Vimscript, and so one may either:

1. Define a |Lua| interface for your mode (see |libmodal-examples|).
	* Use |lua-require| as a |user-command|.
	* See |lua-require-example| for information about how to do this.
	* See `Iron-E/nvim-tabmode` for a complete example.
	* See `Iron-E/mode-fugidiff.lua` on GitHub Gists for another example.
2. |call| `libmodal#Enter()` or `libmodal#Prompt()` from Vimscript.

The following is a reference for high-level functions meant to be used by mode
creators. For those who wish to see a low-level specification of |libmodal|,
see |libmodal-lua|.

Note: Examples for all topics covered here can be found in the "examples"
      folder at the root of the repository.

See: |api|, |lua-api|, https://github.com/Iron-E/nvim-tabmode,
     https://gist.github.com/Iron-E/f36116e8862ea03fd195e4e0a48cb05d

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONS                                           *libmodal-usage-functions*

                    *libmodal-mode* *libmodal#Enter()* *libmodal.mode.enter()*
`libmodal.mode`.enter({name}, {instruction} [, {supressExit}])
`libmodal`#Enter({name}, {instruction} [, {supressExit}])

	Enter a new |vim-mode| using {instruction} to determine what actions will
	be taken upon specific user inputs.

	User input is taken one character at a time using |getchar()|. It is
	passed through a |g:var| determined by the {name} of the mode. For
	example, if {name} is "FOO" then the |g:var| is `g:fooModeInput`.
	Additionally, this input is reported as a |char2nr| number, and as such
	should be decoded with `string.char()` (|nr2char| in |Lua|) if working
	with raw characters is desired.

	To take input on a line-by-line basis, see |libmodal-prompt|.

	Note: `libmodal.mode.enter()`/`libmodal#Enter()` may be called from inside
	      itself. See |libmodal-examples-submodes| for an example.

	Parameters: ~
		{name}         The name of the mode (e.g. |INSERT|).

			- Case-sensitive. Caps are recommended.

		{instruction}  What to do when accepting user input.

			- If {instruction} is a `dict`/`table`, then it is treated as a
			  map of user key-chord to Vim |command|s. Example: >
			      -- LUA
			      local modeInstruction = {
			          ['zf'] = 'split',
			          ['zfo'] = 'vsplit',
			          ['zfc'] = 'tabnew'
			      }

			    " VIMSCRIPT
			    let s:modeInstruction = {
			        'zf': 'split',
			        'zfo': 'vsplit',
			        'zfc': 'tabnew'
			    }
<

			Note: If no `?` key is defined, one will be created automatically.

			- If {instruction} is a `function`, then it is called every time
			  that |getchar()| completes. The user input is received through
			  `g:{name}ModeInput` (see above).

			*Error	you cannot pass a function to Lua from Vimscript!
			      	- If you try to use a |funcref()| for {instruction}, it
			      	  will fail, GUARANTEED. This is because of |E5004|.
			      	- If you want to use a |funcref()| for {instruction}, you
			      	  must use a |Lua| `function` instead.

			Note: Some QoL features are available by default when
			      specifying a `dict`/`table` value for {instruction} that
			      would otherwise have to be programmed manually if a
			      `function` is specified.

			      - A user's typed characters will show in the
			        lower right corner when {instruction} is a table.
			      - If `g:libmodalTimeouts` is enabled, then user input will be
			        subjected to the |timeoutlen|.

		{supressExit}  Whether or not to automatically exit the mode upon an
                       <Esc> press.

			- If |v:false|/`false`, then <Esc> is automatically mapped to
              exiting.
			- If |v:true|/`true`, then <Esc> is ignored unless specified by
			  the user. In such cases, the user should set the
			  `g:`{name}`ModeExit` variable to `true` when exiting is
			  desired. See |libmodal-examples-supress-exit|.

	See also: ~
		|lua-eval|                For type conversions between Vimscript to |Lua|.
		|libmodal-examples-mode|  For examples of this function.


              *libmodal-prompt* *libmodal#Prompt()*  *libmodal.prompt.enter()*
`libmodal.prompt`.enter({name}, {instruction} [, {completions}])
`libmodal`#Prompt({name}, {instruction} [, {completions}])

	Besides accepting user input like keys in |Normal-mode|, |libmodal| is
	also capable of prompting the user for |input| like |Cmdline-mode|. To
	define a |Cmdline-mode|-like prompt, use this function rather than
	`libmodal.mode.enter()`/`libmodal#Enter()`.

	User input is taken using |input()|. It is passed through a |g:var|
	determined by the {name} of the mode. For example, if {name} is "FOO"
	then the |g:var| is `g:fooModeInput`.

	Parameters: ~
		{name}         The name of the mode (e.g. |INSERT|).

			- Case-sensitive. Caps are recommended.

		{instruction}  What to do when accepting user input.

			- If {instruction} is a `dict`/`table`, then it is treated as a
			  map of user inputs to Vim |command|s. Example: >
			      -- LUA
			      local modeInstruction = {
			          ['new']   = 'tabnew',
			          ['close'] = 'tabclose',
			          ['last']  = 'tablast'
			      }

			      " VIMSCRIPT
			      let s:modeInstruction = {
			          'new': 'tabnew',
			          'close': 'tabclose',
			          'last': 'tablast'
			      }
<
			- If {instruction} is a `function`, then it is called
			  every time that |input()| completes. The user input
			  is received through `g:{name}ModeInput` (see above).

			*Error	you cannot pass a function to Lua from Vimscript!
			      	- If you try to use a |funcref()| for {instruction}, it
			      	  will fail, GUARANTEED. This is because of |E5004|.
			      	- If you want to use a |funcref()| for {instruction}, you
			      	  must use a |Lua| `function` instead.

			Note: If you want to create commands with arguments, you will
			      need to use a `function`.

		{completions}  An array-like `table` of commands that are offered by
		               the prompt.

			- Automatically generated when {instruction} is a `table`.
			- Used to provide auto-completion when the user is typing.
			- If unspecified, and {instruction} is not a `table`, then no
			  completions will be provided.

			Note: If no `help` command is defined, one will be created
			      automatically.

3. Examples                                                *libmodal-examples*

Below are examples written in |Lua| to help show how specific features of
|libmodal| may be implemented. In each example, the name of the mode is
defined as "FOO". Additionally, each category of example has one example for
both `function` and `table` {instruction}s.

The source code can be either copied from here or downloaded from the
repository's `examples/lua` folder. Assuming |libmodal| is installed, they can
all be tested using the |luafile| |command|.

See: |libmodal-usage|, |libmodal-use-case|, |lua-require-example|.

==============================================================================
4. Configuration                                      *libmodal-configuration*

The following specifies what settings may be used to configure
|libmodal-mode|s and |libmodal-prompt|s.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HIGHLIGHT GROUPS                                   *libmodal-highlight-groups*


The following |highlight-groups| can be |config|ured to change a mode's |color|s:

Name               Default       Description
----------------   ------------  --------------------------
`LibmodalPrompt`     `ModeMsg`       Color for the mode text.
`LibmodalStar`       `StatusLine`    Color for the prompt text.

Note: `LibmodalStar`'s name — while not indicative of its use — is used for
      the sake of backwards compatability.
	  - While |nvim-libmodal| might not be 100% backwards compatable with
		|vim-libmodal| due to limitations of Neovim 0.4, an update will ship
		when Neovim 0.5 launches that will introduce interoperaability between
		the two.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TIMEOUTS                              *libmodal-timeouts* *g:libmodalTimeouts*

When `libmodal.mode.enter()`'s {instruction} argument is a `table`, mode
creators may also enable the use of Vim's built-in 'timeout' feature.

To enable 'timeout's, one may set the following |variables|:

	Lua: ~
>
	" Set libmodal modes to turn timeouts on.
	vim.g.libmodalTimeouts = true
	" Enable timeouts for specific mode.
	vim.g['{name}ModeTimeouts'] = true
<
	Vimscript: ~
>
	" Set libmodal modes to turn timeouts on.
	let g:libmodalTimeouts = v:true
	" Enable timeouts for specific mode.
	let g:{name}ModeTimeouts = v:true
<


Similarly, to disable them, one may set them to `0` or |v:false|.

When `g:libmodalTimeouts` or `g:{name}ModeTimeouts` is set to `1`, |libmodal|
will automatically execute commands that have mappings that might also be
longer mappings. For example:
	If a mode specifies `zf` and `zfo` as mappings,
	- Turning 'timeout's on will cause `zf` to be executed if the user waits
	  for 'timeoutlen' without typing another character.
	- If 'timeout' were to be off in this case, then the user would either
	  have to hit <CR> to execute `zf` or hit `o` to execute `zfo`.

NOTE: `g:libmodalTimeouts` defaults to the 'timeout' value.

NOTE: The `g:limbodalTimeouts` variable should NOT be defined by plugins.
      - Allow users to decide whether or not they want timeouts to be
        enabled globally themselves.

NOTE: Mode-specific timeout variables will override `g:libmodalTimeouts`.

When enabled, |libmodal-timeouts| will reference the mode user's 'timeoutlen'
as specified in their |config|. This way, modes will feel consistent to users
by default.

However, mode creators may change 'timeoutlen' upon entrance of a mode, and
then reset it upon exit. Example:

	Vimscript: ~
>
		function! s:FooMode() abort
			" Get the user's preferred timeout length.
			let l:timeoutlen = &timeoutlen
			" Set it to something else, like 1500ms
			let &timeoutlen = 1500
			" Enter a mode
			call libmodal#Enter(…)
			" Reset the timeout
			let &timeoutlen = l:timeoutlen
		endfunction
<
	Lua: ~
>
		local api = vim.api
		local libmodal = require('libmodal')

		function fooMode()
			-- Get the user's preferred timeout length.
			local prevTimeoutLen = vim.o.timeoutlen
			-- Set it to something else, like 1500ms.
			vim.o.timeoutlen = 1500
			-- Enter a mode.
			libmodal.mode.enter(…)
			-- Restore the `timeoutlen`
			vim.o.timeoutlen = prevTimeoutLen
		end
<

Mode creators who use `function` {instruction}s may define timeouts manually
using |timers|, which is how |libmodal| implements them internally.

7. Contributing                                        *libmodal-contributing*

The following describes what should be done if an individual wishes to
contribute something to the `Iron-E/nvim-libmodal` repository.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CODE                                              *libmodal-contributing-code*

	Bugfixes ~

	If you discover a bug and believe you know the solution to fixing it, then
	submit a bug report and state that you are working on a fix (and what that
	fix might be), and what general timeframe the fix may be completed in
	(months, weeks, days, etc.).

	When the fix is complete, submit a PR that references the issue you
	submitted.

	Features ~

	If there is a feature you would like to be a part of |libmodal|, the best
	thing you can do is submit a feature request, and then state that you are
	working on a pull request (PR) so others don't attempt to do the same work
	at the same time.

	When you believe your feature is complete, write some examples for it in
	the `examples/lua` folder, and add them to |libmodal-examples| as
	appropriate.

	Assure that all existing |libmodal-examples| continue to work with your
	feature, unless a breaking change was discussed on the feature request.
	If you need help getting them to pass, you can ask for help on the PR.

	Reference the issue you submitted on the PR so that the two show up
	together when looking back at the history.

	Contributing documentation is not necessary but appreciated, since the
	person who knows the most about the feature being implemented is most
	likely the one implementing it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DOCUMENTATION                            *libmodal-contributing-documentation*

If there is a problem with the documentation, or you see an area where it
could be improved, don't hesitate to submit an issue and a PR. At the very
least it will exist in history if such an issue comes up again, and likely it
will serve to help yourself and others with more clear and concise wording, or
with more helpful and practical examples.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ISSUES                                          *libmodal-contributing-issues*

Issues are greatly welcomed on the GitHub repository, whether they are bug
reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, or misunderstandings:
it's all good to have in the archive.

When submitting an issue, please describe the following:

1. Context regarding the issue (how you discovered it, pertinent information,
   etc.)
2. Detailed description of the issue.
3. Steps to reproduce (if applicable).
4. Expected behavior (if applicable).

8. Changelog                                              *libmodal-changelog*

0.5.0 ~

	Additions: ~
	* New class `libmodal.collections.Stack`.
	* New class `libmodal.Mode`.
	* New class `libmodal.Mode.Popup`.
	* New class `libmodal.Prompt`.
	* New class `libmodal.Vars`.

	Breaking Changes: ~
	* Moved `libmodal.mode.ParseTable` to `libmodal.collections.ParseTable`.
	* Removed `libmodal.utils.vars`.
	* Moved `libmodal.utils.Indicator` to `libmodal.Indicator`.
	* Moved `libmodal.utils.Indicator.Entry` to
	  `libmodal.Indicator.HighlightSegment`.

	Changes: ~
	* Allow creation of |libmodal-mode| and |libmodal-prompt| table-objects.
		* Call `libmodal.Mode.new()` or `libmodal.Prompt.new()` to create one.
			* Call `{mode}:enter()` to enter the mode.
		* More consistent mode recursion with `libmodal.collections.Stack`.
		* Mode creators can now override specific functionality by copying
		  portions of the source code, or changing the values that are
		  referenced by the mode directly.
			* This allows for finer control over how a mode behaves.
			* It also allows for modes to inherit each other through
			  `setmetatable()`.

	* Removed program logic from `libmodal.mode.enter()`.
		* Now internally calls `libmodal.Mode.new(…):enter()` instead.
	* Removed program logic from `libmodal.prompt.enter()`.
		* Now internally calls `libmodal.Prompt.new(…):enter()` instead.


	Fixes: ~
	* Fix unexpected behavior when repeating `libmodal.mode.enter()` calls
	  with the from within themselves.
	  * Mode popup windows may be closed prematurely by entering two different
	    modes and then exiting them in reverse order, among other things. All
	    previously known mysterious behavior is corrected.

0.3.1 ~
